      <h2 class="title">About New Zealand</h2>
      <p class="description">New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. 
         It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island and the South Island and over 700 smaller islands.
         It is the sixth-largest island country by area, covering 268,021 square kilometres. 
         New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres 
         south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. </p>

    <h3 class="title">About New Zealand history</h3>
    <p class="description">
      New Zealand was the last major landmass settled by humans. 
      The story of Kupe as the first human to set foot on the New Zealand archipelago, 
      accredited to by most Māori iwi, is considered credible by historians; he is generally 
      believed to have existed historically.

    <h3 class="title">Who are Māori ?</h3>
    <p class="description">
      Māori are tangata whenua — people of the land. They came to Aotearoa from Polynesia in the 
      13th century and created a new language and culture. Tangata whenua is a noun - tangata whenua - 
      used to describe the Maori people of a particular locality or the original inhabitants of New Zealand.

    <h3 class="title">What is Aotearoa ?</h3>
    <p class="description">
      Aotearoa is the contemporary Māori language name for New Zealand. The name was originally used by 
      Māori in reference to only the North Island, the name of the whole country being Aotearoa.

    <h3 class="title">Polynesian islands in internal conflict at that time ? </h3>
    <img id="img6" class="img" src="./polynesianislands.jpg" alt="A picture of Polynesianislands" />
    <p class="description">It is thought by some historians that Hawaiki and other 
      Polynesian islands were experiencing considerable internal conflict at that time, which is 
      thought to have caused an exodus from them. Some historians contest that this was because of the 
      fallout from the 1257 Samalas eruption, which caused crop devastation globally and possibly helped trigger the Little Ice Age.</p>

    <h3 class="title">What is Hawaiki ?</h3>
    <p class="description">In Polynesian mythology, Hawaiki is the original home of the Polynesians, 
      before dispersal across Polynesia. It also features as the underworld in many Māori stories.

    <h3 class="title">What is 1257 Samalas eruption ?</h3>
    <p class="description">In 1257, a catastrophic eruption occurred at the Samalas volcano on the Indonesian island of Lombok. 
      The event had a probable Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7, making it one of the largest volcanic eruptions 
      during the current Holocene epoch. It left behind a large caldera that contains Lake Segara Anak.

    <h3 class="title">What is the Little Ice Age ?</h3>
    <p class="description">
      The Little Ice Age was a period of regional cooling, particularly pronounced in the North Atlantic 
      region. It was not a true ice age of global extent. The term was introduced into scientific literature 
      by François E. Matthes in 1939
